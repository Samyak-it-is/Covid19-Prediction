# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains a project for analyzing and predicting COVID-19 data using various machine learning models and data visualization techniques. The project uses data from the COVID-19 dataset and provides insights and predictions on confirmed, recovered, and death cases globally and for specific countries like India and the US.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the required libraries. You can install them using the following command:

# USAGE
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid19-data-analysis.git
cd covid19-data-analysis

# Run the Script:
python covid_analysis.py

# Data Analysis
The script performs various data analysis tasks, including:

Reading and preprocessing the data.
Calculating the total number of confirmed, recovered, and death cases.
Grouping the data by observation date and summarizing the cases.

# Visualization
The script generates several plots to visualize the data:

Bar plots of active and closed cases.
Line plots showing weekly progress of confirmed, recovered, and death cases.
Bar plots showing weekly increase in confirmed and death cases.
Comparison of the number of cases in the top 15 countries.

# Model Training and Prediction
The script trains and uses three models for prediction:

Linear Regression (with normalization using StandardScaler).
Support Vector Regression (SVR) with polynomial kernel.
Holt's Linear Trend Model.
The models are trained on the number of days since the first observation and the number of confirmed cases. Predictions are made for the next 17 days.

# Results
The script outputs various results, including:

Average daily increase in confirmed, recovered, and death cases.
Predicted values for the next 17 days using Linear Regression, SVR, and Holt's Linear Model.
